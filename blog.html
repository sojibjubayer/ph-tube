                    The scope of var, let, and const</h2>
                <p>The keywords var, let, and const allow us to declare variables. A variable can be declared in
                    javascript using the venerable
                    Var variable method. We utilize the let and const variables in the current javascript, which was
                    included in the ES2015(ES6)
                    update; it is now used more commonly in modern javascript than the var variable.
                <p class="italic">scope:Scope basically refers to the area in which these variables can be used. Var
                    declarations can be function/locally or globally scoped.</p>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mt-5">
                <h2 class="bg-white p-2 rounded md:w-[20%] text-blue-700">scope of var</h2>
                <p>When a var variable is declared outside of a function, the scope is global. This means that any
                    variable declared outside of a function block using the var keyword is accessible throughout the
                    entire window.
                    When a variable is declared inside a function, it has function scope. This indicates that it is
                    accessible and limited to that function.</p>
                <p>Hoisting of var:

                    Before code is executed, variables and function declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope
                    in JavaScript.
                    As a result, var variables are initialized with the value undefined and raised to the top of their
                    scope.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mt-5">
                <h2 class="bg-white p-2 rounded md:w-[20%] text-blue-700">scope of let </h2>
                <p>Let is now the preferred syntax for declaring variables.A variable declared in a block with let can
                    only be used in that block.
                    A block is a section of code that is bounded by. Curly braces house a block. A block is anything
                    contained in curly brackets.
                    Let is a superior option to var due to this feature. If you've used a name for a variable before,
                    you don't need to worry while using let because a variable only exists within its scope.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mt-5">
                <h2 class="bg-white p-2 rounded md:w-[20%] text-blue-700">scope of const</h2>
                <p>Constant values are kept for variables specified using the const keyword.
                    The scope of const declarations is blocked.
                    Const declarations, like let declarations are only accessible within the block in which they were
                    made.
                    It is impossible to modify or re-declare const.
                    This indicates that within the scope of a variable declared with const, its value will not change.
                    It cannot be changed or declared again.

                    <h2 class="bg-white p-2 rounded md:w-[20%] text-blue-700">undefined</h2>
                    <p>undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
                        undefined is a type by itself (undefined).
                        Unassigned variables are initialized by JavaScript with a default value of undefined.
                    <p>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also
                        returns
                        undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function
                        returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
                    <p>While you can use undefined as an identifier (variable name) in any scope other than the global
                        scope (because undefined is not a reserved word), doing so is a very bad idea that will make
                        your code difficult to maintain and debug.</p>
                    <p>You can use undefined and the strict equality and inequality operators to determine whether a
                        variable has a value. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="mt-5">
                    <h2 class="bg-white p-2 rounded md:w-[20%] text-blue-700">null</h2>
                    <p>On the other hand, null is an object. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no
                        value. JavaScript never
                        sets a value to null. That must be done programmatically.</p>
                    <p>A null value in JavaScript is used for referring absence of any object value and if any function
                        or variable returns null,
                        then we can infer that the object could not be created.</p>

                <p class="italic">When used in conditional logic both undefined and null will return false.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>1.Intentional Absence of Value: Developers can assign null to a variable or property to indicate
                        that
                        there is no value or that the value is intentionally missing or unknown.</p>

                    <p>In this case, myVariable is explicitly set to null to signify that it doesn't have a meaningful
                        value.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>2.Function Return Values: Functions may return null to indicate that they did not produce a valid
                        result or that an error occurred.</p>

                    <p>Here, null is returned when the target element is not found.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>3.As a Placeholder: Sometimes, developers use null as a placeholder for an object or a value that
                        will be assigned later.</p>

                        optional values.</p>

                    <p>1.Default Function Parameters: When a function is called with fewer arguments than declared
                        parameters, the missing parameters are automatically set to undefined.</p>

                <div>

                    <p>4.Function Return Values: If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it returns undefined
                        by default.
                    </p>

                    REST API</h2>
                <p>An API for a website is code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other.</p>
                <p>A RESTful API -- also referred to as a RESTful web service or REST API -- is based on
                    representational
                    state transfer (REST), which is an architectural style and approach to communications often used in
                    web services development.</p>

                <p>A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP
                    requests to access and use data. That data can be used
                    to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and
                    deleting of operations concerning resources.</p>
                <p>REST technology is generally preferred over other similar technologies. This tends to be the case
                    because REST uses less bandwidth, making it more suitable for efficient internet usage. RESTful APIs
                    can also be built with programming languages such as JavaScript or Python.</p>
                <p class="mt-4 font-bold">How RESTful APIs work</p>
                <p>A RESTful API uses commands to obtain resources. The state of a resource at any given timestamp is
                    called a resource representation. A RESTful API uses existing HTTP methodologies defined by the RFC
                    2616 protocol, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GET to retrieve a resource;</li>
                    <li>PUT to change the state of or update a resource, which can be an object, file or block;</li>
                    <li>POST to create that resource; and</li>
                    <li>DELETE to remove it.</li>

                </ul>
